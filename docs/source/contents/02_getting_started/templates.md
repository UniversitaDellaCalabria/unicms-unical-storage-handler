Templates
---------

Templates are managed as atomic, inheritable and composable elements,
which can also be used in uniCMS to create independent
[blocks](https://unicms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/usage.html#page-blocks)
to be inserted in its pages.

Every single template is a combination of ***HTML***, ***Django tags*** and ***Vue.js***.
This approach is extremely flexible.

#### Blocks
