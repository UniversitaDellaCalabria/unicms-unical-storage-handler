Using ***uniCMS*** for the realization of a web project in an ***Italian university***
represents an important design and communication challenge.

Being able to distribute a large amount of content in an organic and
orderly way to a wide range of users (students who want to enroll,
enrolled students, graduates, teachers, staff, local companies) requires
the use of ***modern technologies*** capable of facilitating the non-redundant
insertion and the immediate availability of information.

In this context, this app is an adequate solution for the management
and the right graphical representation of the data coming from a
specific API source.
